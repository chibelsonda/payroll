API CONTRACT RULES:

- The existing API response format is a CONTRACT.
- It must NEVER be broken.

- Always:
  - Inspect existing endpoints before modifying or adding new ones
  - Copy the same response shape

- Never:
  - Return raw models
  - Return ad-hoc arrays
  - Change key names
  - Change nesting structure

- If unsure:
  - Search for similar endpoint
  - Follow its response format exactly
