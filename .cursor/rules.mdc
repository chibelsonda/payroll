# Cursor Project Rules (Laravel + Vue Payroll System)

## 🎯 PRIMARY GOALS
- Minimize token usage
- Prefer SMALL, TARGETED edits
- Never refactor unrelated files
- Never rewrite whole files unless explicitly asked
- Always respect existing architecture

---

## 🧠 THINKING RULES

- Before coding:
  - Analyze the existing codebase first
  - Identify the MINIMAL change needed
- DO NOT:
  - Reformat files
  - Rename variables
  - Reorder imports
  - Change code style
  - Touch unrelated files

---

## 📁 FILE SCOPE RULES

- Only modify files that are:
  - Explicitly mentioned by the user, OR
  - Absolutely required for the fix

- If more than 3 files are needed:
  - STOP and ask before continuing

---

## 🧱 LARAVEL RULES

- Prefer:
  - Migrations over raw SQL
  - Eloquent over raw queries (unless performance critical)
- Never:
  - Edit old migrations that already ran
  - Break backwards compatibility
- When dealing with Spatie Permission:
  - ALWAYS assume teams (company_id) is enabled
  - ALWAYS require company context when assigning roles

---

## 🗃️ DATABASE RULES (PostgreSQL)

- Avoid:
  - Duplicate indexes
  - Duplicate columns
- Remember:
  - morphs() creates columns + index
  - unique() creates index
  - foreignId()->constrained() creates index

---

## 🧪 DEBUGGING RULES

- When an error occurs:
  - Fix ONLY the root cause
  - Do NOT refactor surrounding code
  - Do NOT "improve" code unless asked

---

## 🧩 VUE RULES

- Vue 3 + Composition API
- Do NOT rewrite components
- Do NOT change UI or layout unless explicitly requested
- Keep changes minimal and local

---

## 🤖 AI USAGE OPTIMIZATION

- Prefer:
  - Small patches
  - Surgical edits
- Avoid:
  - "Full file rewrite"
  - "Project-wide refactor"
  - "Cleanup passes"

---

## 🛑 HARD STOPS

- If a change will:
  - Touch many files
  - Affect architecture
  - Change business logic

→ STOP and ASK FIRST.

---

## 🧾 OUTPUT FORMAT

- When editing code:
  - Show ONLY the changed lines
  - Or show a very small diff-style patch

- Never dump full files unless explicitly asked.

---

## 🏁 SUCCESS CRITERIA

- Code compiles
- Tests still pass
- No unrelated changes
- Minimal token usage
