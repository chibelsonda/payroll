LARAVEL BACKEND RULES

Prefer:
- Eloquent over raw SQL
- Services over fat controllers
- Request classes for validation

Never:
- Edit old migrations that already ran
- Break API responses
- Change business logic unless asked

When fixing bugs:
- Fix ONLY the bug
- Do NOT refactor surrounding code

Architecture:
- Respect current structure
- No folder reorganization
- No namespace changes


API RESPONSE RULES:

- ALWAYS follow the existing API response format.
- NEVER change:
  - JSON structure
  - Envelope keys (e.g., success, data, message)
  - Pagination format
  - Error format
- If an endpoint returns:
  { success, data, message }
  → ALL new or modified endpoints MUST follow the same format.

- NEVER "improve" or "simplify" API responses unless explicitly asked.

---

SERVICE LAYER RULES:

- Business logic MUST go into Service classes.
- Controllers MUST:
  - Validate request
  - Call a Service
  - Return the response

- NEVER:
  - Put business logic in controllers
  - Put heavy logic in routes
  - Mix query logic and HTTP logic

- If logic already exists in a Service:
  - Reuse it
  - Do NOT duplicate it
