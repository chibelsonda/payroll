# LARAVEL BACKEND RULES

## ✅ Prefer:
- Eloquent over raw SQL
- Services over fat controllers
- Request classes for validation

## ❌ Never:
- Edit old migrations that already ran
- Break API responses
- Change business logic unless asked

## 🧠 When fixing bugs:
- Fix ONLY the bug
- Do NOT refactor surrounding code

## 🏗️ Architecture:
- Respect current structure
- No folder reorganization
- No namespace changes
